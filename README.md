# Dodeca

Live Site -> https://dodeca.netlify.app/

Dodeca is a landing page that I created to improve my design skills.

Built in React and styled with Styled Components.

I used AOS for the animations: https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

And React-rellax for the parrallax effect: https://nelo.is/writing/introducing-react-rellax/
